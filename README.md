## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey! I am Vedant. I really enjoy taking ideas and turning them into systems that think, learn, and react in smart ways.  
I get pretty fascinated by the way basic math rules can grow into big models. Those models end up handling things like images, text, sound, and even figuring out what people really mean.  

I spend most of my time experimenting with:

- 🧠 **How models behave** when pushed beyond standard textbook tasks  
- ⚙️ **Designing clean ML pipelines** that feel reliable, not hacky  
- 🤖 **Building agents** that can operate inside games and real-world apps  
- 📊 **Studying why models fail**, not just when they succeed

The idea that fires me up the most involves a small chunk of code. If you structure it right, that code turns into something useful, interactive, and actually intelligent.  

When I step away from ML work, I still like poking around with different tools. I automate workflows where I can. I try to make systems communicate better with humans overall.  
Every single project I put together moves me closer to getting how intelligence gets built from scratch.  

If you happen to be tackling something cool in AI, I would really like to connect with you.

## 🧠 Expertise

I enjoy building intelligent systems end-to-end, from understanding the raw data to deploying models that actually solve problems.  
Over time, I have developed a workflow that balances experimentation with clean engineering.

### 🤖 Machine Learning
I work with classical and modern ML techniques, focusing on clarity and reliability:
- Classification & regression models  
- Feature engineering & data preprocessing  
- Evaluation, tuning, and error analysis  

### 🧠 Deep Learning
I build neural systems that understand patterns in images, text, and sequential data:
- CNNs for vision tasks  
- Transformer-based architectures  
- Training loop design, augmentation, optimization strategies  

### 👁️ Computer Vision
Turning visual information into structured insights:
- Image classification & recognition  
- Segmentation and mask-based analysis  
- Applied use in healthcare and automation projects  

### 💬 Natural Language Processing
Making models understand and generate meaningful text:
- LLM prompting & fine-tuning  
- Sentiment analysis, summarization  
- Agent-style behavior and instruction following  

### ⚙️ MLOps & Deployment
Ensuring models don’t just work *locally* but run reliably in real scenarios:
- FastAPI-based APIs  
- Model packaging & environment management  
- Experiment tracking, logging, and reproducibility

## 🎯 2025 Goals

I’m focusing this year on sharpening my engineering mindset and pushing myself beyond comfort-zone projects.  
Here’s what I’m actively working toward:

### 🚀 1. Build Smarter, More Autonomous AI Systems
Move beyond static models and create agents that can reason, plan, and act with real context — starting with PhiCraft and expanding into LLM-driven tools.

### 📦 2. Ship Real, Production-Ready ML Products
Turn experimental notebooks into reliable systems:
- APIs  
- dashboards  
- deployable pipelines  

### 🧪 3. Dive Deeper Into Model Behavior
Understand *why* models make decisions — not just how to train them.  
Focus on interpretability, debugging, and improving failure cases.

### 🧱 4. Strengthen My Foundations
Revisit the fundamentals that actually scale:
- optimization  
- data structures  
- system design applied to ML workflows  

### 🌍 5. Contribute Back to the AI Community
Open-source work, clean repositories, readable implementations, and sharing real learnings through writeups or tutorials.

### 🤝 6. Collaborate on Something Meaningful
Join teams or individuals pushing boundaries in AI — research, applied ML, or product-focused development.

This year is all about depth, consistency, and building things that actually matter.
